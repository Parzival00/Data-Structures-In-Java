# Graphing in Java

This repository comes from an asssignment I did in my data structures class in school.
In this class we used Java to learn how to code and implement many different data structures.
This particular assigment was to represent the vertices and edges of a graph using arrays or lists.
It displays the number of vertices, the vertext at index 1, number of edges, a list of edges, and creates a new graph with 5 vertices
